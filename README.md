# AI Screenshot Renamer

Automatically rename screenshot image files using AI-generated descriptions of their contents.

Instead of generic filenames like `Screenshot 2024-01-01.png`, screenshots are renamed to short, meaningful names based on what the image shows.

---

## What this script does

- Scans a folder for screenshot images
- Sends each image to a local AI vision model
- Generates a short, descriptive filename
- Renames the image accordingly

This makes screenshots easier to search, organize, and understand later.

---

## Requirements

- Python **3.8+**
- **Ollama** installed and running locally
- A **vision-capable Ollama model** (for example: `llava`)

---

## Ollama setup

1. Install Ollama  
   https://ollama.com

2. Pull a vision model:
   ```bash
   ollama pull llava
## Ollama setup

## Ollama setup

Make sure Ollama is running:

```bash
ollama serve
Get started
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/shruthikab/ai-screenshot-renamer.git
cd ai-screenshot-renamer
(Optional) Install Python dependencies if required:

bash
pip install pillow requests
Place the screenshots you want to rename in the folder expected by the script
(or update the folder path inside screenshot_renamer.py).

Usage
Run the script:
python screenshot_renamer.py

Each screenshot will be renamed based on its visual content.

Notes
Filenames are generated by an AI model and may vary

Similar screenshots may receive similar names

Existing files with the same name may be overwritten unless handled in the script
